This is the PyCharm directory for the Walabot breathing project

Project Description:

This is a python project that uses a radio frequency device called walabot, in addition to the machine learning algorithm Random Forrests,
in order to detect breathing action and record data. A hue light is being used as an indicator,  being triggered when there is breathing action.

Software: pyCharm, Random Forrests algorithm, Hue API
Hardware: Walabot developer, Hue light

2- Make sure the Walabot API is installed and placed in the correct directory as coded in the "Predictions.py" file.
3- Update Hue light information in the code if needed
4- Connect your Walabot Device through USB
5- Hang your walabot device to an adjacent wall and secure it to where its stationary, with the Z+ access facing towards the breathing person
6- Run the "Predictions.py" and the breathing predictions will start occuring.
